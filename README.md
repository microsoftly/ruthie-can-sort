## Running Tests
You can run tests running `yarn test` in the command line/
## Instructions
### Implementation
Implement the sorting algorithms
### Testing
Verify that the sorting algorithms are implemented correctly by adding additional tests
### Submission for Review
After you finish implementing one or more algorithms, commit and push the changes to a new branch. Go to github and open up a PR (pull request) against the main branch so that Matt can review the implementations
## Next steps
### Performance testing
Add tests to verify the performance of different algorithms (e.g. bubblesort should be faster than quicksort except in the unlikely worst case)
### Add CI (Continuous Integration)
#### Tests
Add CI checks that ensure that your tests pass on every PR
#### Linting
Add CI checks that ensure that style is properly followed in subsequent work. (This is called linting and is performed with a linter)
### HTTP API
Create an HTTP api provides the sorting algorithms via an http interface
#### Integration tests
create integration tests against said API
